Leadership and management was the topic we had yesterday in the discussion in Manager Pilot Training class. The discussion was pretty open and I gained some ideas on this interesting topic. Despite sharing the common similarities that were agreed by majority of the people in the class, they have also subtantial differences.

## What is the real difference between Leadership and Management

After looking around to find these differences, an article actually gave me the answer and I could not agree more on the points it offers when looking back at my coaching and leading experience.

According to this article, there are five levels of leadership.

The first one is **informal leader**, the leader who provides direction and guidance. This man steps up and take responsibility of the situation regardless of not having the position.

The second sort of leadership is called **hands-on leader**, the ones who directly put their hands on producing the results.

Level three is the **expert leader**. To some extent, this leader is similar to the **hands-on leader** when he helps to shape the project. He also guides the team with rich expertise and knowledge.

The forth level - **engaging and enabling leader** - at this stage, direct contribution to the results is no more the first priority. He is intent on engaging people, building team and setting up things for his team members to deliver.

The last and highest level, **aspirational leader**, focuses on creating team culture and leveraging environment for sustainable success.


There is to say that, when leveling up, it is more about connecting and managing people rather than focusing merely on the expertise and knowledge domain. It is not How well you know, but Who is the one you trust to give the correct answer. And that is the road to go from a leader to a manager.

At this point of career path, I believe that it is the right time for me personally to carefully consider different options for future growth.
